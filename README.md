# Laurids Gerner Ejersbo — ACD-E25 Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio documents four computational design studies developed for the course Advanced Computational Design at the Southern University of Denmark (SDU). Across the series, I investigate rule-based and emergent form generation through algorithmic modeling, recursion, parametric design, and agent-based systems, iterating through prototypes, parameter sweeps, and visual evaluation

## Assignments

### A1: NumPy Array Manipulation for 2D Pattern Generation
In A1, I develop a pixel-based pattern generator using NumPy array operations to transform a blank canvas into structured, colorized images. The work focuses on compositional logic (rules + constraints) and controlled randomness to produce a family of variations.

### A2: Exploring Fractals through Recursive Geometric Patterns
In A2, I build a recursive geometric system to explore branching and fractal-like growth. I test how parameter choices (e.g., depth, angle, scaling, and spatial influences) affect density, hierarchy, and legibility of the resulting forms.

### A3: Parametric Structural Canopy
In A3, I design a canopy system driven by a heightmap/field and implemented in Grasshopper/GhPython. I evaluate panelization/tessellation strategies and generate a structural support logic that responds to curvature, span, and local conditions.

### A4: Agent-Based Modeling for Surface Panelization
In A4, the intention was to use agent-based behavior to sample and rationalize a surface into a panelized system. Geometric parameters such as slope and curvature were intended to influence the agents’ behavior. However, a persistent bug remains in the implementation, which limits the resulting output. I have chosen to present this actual result rather than an idealized outcome generated solely by LLMs, as it still demonstrates my approach to algorithmic thinking and reflects an authentic design process in which the outcome is shaped by my own decisions and interventions.
